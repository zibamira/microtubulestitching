Download mpir version 2.2.1 from http://www.mpir.org/ and unpack.

For Linux 64 build:
Go to the main directory and type 
./configure --enable-gmpcompat --disable-shared --enable-cxx --prefix PATH_TO_YOUR_INSTALL_FOLDER
./make
./make check
./make install


In PATH_TO_YOUR_INSTALL_FOLDER you should now have a lib and include directory which contain the files neeeded for the prepacked.

Libdai will compile and link with a gcc4.1 compiler but crash when running. This is probably due to a bug which was reported here:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20647
Since gcc 4.4 works fine I did not look into it any further.


For Windows:
Open the .sln file in the build.vc9 directory.

In Visual Studio, right click on the lib_mpir_core2 project and click on "Properties".
Set "Platform" to Active(x64).
Go to C++/"Code Generation".
Set "Runtime Library" to "Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)" for Debug.
Set "Runtime Library" to "Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)" for Release.
Repeat this step for lib_mpir_cxx.

Build both projects.

The libraries and headers should now be in the mpir-2.2.1\build.vc9\lib\x64 folder.
